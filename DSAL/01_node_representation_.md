# Chapter 1: Node Representation

Welcome to the DSAL project tutorials! We're thrilled to have you here. This first chapter is all about a super important concept in computer science and programming: the **Node**. Don't worry, it's much simpler than it might sound!

## What's the Big Idea? Building with Blocks!

Imagine you have a big box of LEGO bricks. You can use these individual bricks to build all sorts of amazing things â€“ castles, spaceships, cars, you name it! Each LEGO brick is a basic building block.

In the world of data structures (which are ways to organize information in a computer), a **node** is like that LEGO brick. It's the most basic unit we use to build bigger, more complex structures like lists, trees, and graphs.

Think about organizing information:
*   A family tree connects parents to children.
*   A book is organized into chapters, which have sections, which might have subsections.
*   A map shows cities connected by roads.

In all these examples, we have individual pieces of information (a person, a chapter title, a city) that are somehow *connected* to other pieces. Nodes help us represent both the information *and* the connections.

## So, What Exactly IS a Node?

A node is simply a small container that holds two main things:

1.  **Data:** The actual piece of information we want to store (like a person's name, a number, a book chapter title, a city name).
2.  **Pointers (or Links/References):** These are special connections that point to *other* nodes. Think of them like arrows or strings connecting one LEGO brick to another. These pointers are what allow us to build structures and show relationships between data.

Let's look at how we define a node in C++, the language used in the DSAL project. We often use something called a `struct` (short for structure) to define our node blueprint.

Here's a very simple example:

```c++
// A basic blueprint for a node
struct SimpleNode {
    int data;           // Holds the information (e.g., a number)
    SimpleNode *next;   // A pointer (link) to the *next* node
};
```

*   `struct SimpleNode`: This line declares that we're creating a new blueprint called `SimpleNode`.
*   `int data;`: This defines a place inside the node to store an integer (a whole number). This is our data part.
*   `SimpleNode *next;`: This is the pointer part. The `*` means it's a pointer (an address pointing to somewhere in memory). It's designed to point to *another* node of the same type (`SimpleNode`). We call it `next` because, in simple structures like lists, it often points to the next item in a sequence. If there's no next node, this pointer is often set to `NULL` (meaning it points to nothing).

## Different Structures, Different Nodes

Just like LEGO bricks come in different shapes and sizes for different purposes, the exact definition of a node changes depending on the data structure we're building.

Let's peek at some node definitions from the DSAL code snippets you provided:

**1. Binary Search Tree (BST) Node:**

Trees often need to connect to nodes below them, typically called "children". A Binary Search Tree usually has a left child and a right child.

```c++
// From DSAL code: 4_BST.cpp
struct node
{
    int data;   // The value stored in the node (e.g., 50)
    node *L;    // Pointer to the left child node
    node *R;    // Pointer to the right child node
};
```

Here, instead of just `next`, we have `L` (for Left) and `R` (for Right) pointers. This allows us to build branching structures, which we'll explore in [Chapter 2: Tree Structures (BST, AVL, OBST, GLL)](02_tree_structures__bst__avl__obst__gll__.md).

**2. Book Structure (GLL) Node:**

Remember the book example (chapters, sections)? This uses a more complex node to handle different levels of hierarchy.

```c++
// From DSAL code: 3_Book.cpp / 3_Book (1).cpp
struct node
{
    char name[20]; // Data: Name (e.g., "Chapter 1", "Introduction")
    node *next;    // Link to the next item at the *same* level
                   // (e.g., "Chapter 1" -> "Chapter 2")
    node *down;    // Link to the *first item* one level down
                   // (e.g., "Chapter 1" -> "Section 1.1")
    int flag;      // A helper value (e.g., to know if this node
                   // has items below it)
};
```

This `node` has:
*   `name`: Stores text (like a chapter title).
*   `next`: Points sideways to the next chapter or section *at the same level*.
*   `down`: Points downwards to the start of the next level (like the first section within a chapter).
*   `flag`: An integer used for internal bookkeeping.

This structure lets us represent nested information like a book's table of contents. We'll see more of this in [Chapter 2: Tree Structures (BST, AVL, OBST, GLL)](02_tree_structures__bst__avl__obst__gll__.md).

**3. Graph Node (Flight Paths):**

Graphs represent connections between many items, like cities connected by flights. A node here might represent a city, and its pointers link to adjacent cities reachable by flight.

```c++
// From DSAL code: 6_Flight.cpp (adjacency list part)
struct node
{
    string vertex; // Data: Name of the connected city (e.g., "Paris")
    int time;      // Data: Time to reach this city (e.g., 120 mins)
    node *next;    // Link to the *next* city reachable from the
                   // same origin city in the list.
};
```

This node stores the destination city (`vertex`), the travel `time`, and a `next` pointer to list other cities reachable from the starting point. We'll cover this in detail in [Chapter 5: Graph Representation](05_graph_representation_.md).

## Creating and Connecting Nodes

So we have these blueprints (`struct node`), but how do we actually make and connect the nodes?

1.  **Creation:** In C++, we typically use the `new` keyword to allocate memory for a new node based on our blueprint. The `create()` function in `3_Book.cpp` is a great example:

    ```c++
    // Simplified from 3_Book.cpp Gll::create()
    node* create_a_new_node() {
        // 1. Ask the system for memory for one 'node'
        node *p = new node;

        // 2. Make sure its pointers start empty (NULL)
        p->next = NULL;
        p->down = NULL;
        p->flag = 0;

        // 3. Get the data (the name) from the user
        cout << "\n enter the name: ";
        cin >> p->name;

        // 4. Return the newly created node
        return p;
    }
    ```
    This function creates a single, isolated node, gets its data, and gives it back to us.

2.  **Connecting:** Once we have two nodes, say `nodeA` and `nodeB`, we connect them by setting the pointer of one node to point to the other. For example, to make `nodeA` point to `nodeB` using the `next` pointer:

    ```c++
    // Assuming nodeA and nodeB are pointers to existing nodes
    nodeA->next = nodeB; // Make nodeA's 'next' arrow point to nodeB
    ```

We can visualize this linking process:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Before Linking
        A1[Node A <br> data: 10 <br> next: null]
        B1[Node B <br> data: 20 <br> next: null]
    end
    subgraph After Linking (nodeA->next = nodeB)
        A2[Node A <br> data: 10 <br> next: B2] --> B2[Node B <br> data: 20 <br> next: null];
    end
```

By creating nodes and setting their pointers, we build up the entire data structure, whether it's a simple list, a complex tree, or an interconnected graph.

## Conclusion

You've just learned about the fundamental building block of many data structures: the **node**.

*   Think of it like a LEGO brick: it holds **data** and has **pointers** (connections) to other nodes.
*   The exact structure (`struct`) of a node depends on the data structure it's part of (like BSTs, book structures, or graphs).
*   We create nodes (often using `new`) and link them together by setting their pointer fields.

Understanding nodes is the first crucial step towards mastering how data structures work. With this foundation, you're ready to see how we connect these nodes to create powerful ways of organizing information.
